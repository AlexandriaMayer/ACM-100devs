            <h1>hi welcome to Waterloo, tx</h1>
            <h2>or Austin, TX, depending on which documents you're looking at</h2>
            <p>When I talk about my urban fantast version of Austin, people usually ask me, 
                "Allie, why is the city like this?" and the usual response is <span>"It came to me in a dream"</span><br>
            No, literally. I have vivid dreams and I remember a lot of them. In late 2021, I drew out a map of Austin according to what's seen in my dreams.<br>
            This map became basis for the world building I was doing for a urban fantasy story.<br>
            I still need to write the story.
            </p>
            <h3>Let's start with</h3>
            <h2>The Loop</h2>
            <p>In 2017, I had a dream that Austin had a subway loop running downtown instead of Capital Metro's existing commuter rain.<br>
            It was 5 miles long, running under Guadalupe Street, Dean Keaton, Red River Rd, and Cesar Chavez St. It had stations at Republic Square, South Congress, the Convention Center, E 12th, E MLK Jr, Dean Keaton/San Jacinto, W 24th, and W 12th<br>
            There was one question I asked before I woke up: <span>"Is it better for me to ride a subway that doesn't go beyond downtown, or a infrequent commuter train that sort of goes to my part of town?"</span>
            <h3>The Answer Is: God, yes.</h3>
            <p>Do you know how many billions in taxpayer dollars are saved because someone built a subway tunnel in the 1980s? Even if the rest of the system is at grade, a downtown subway loop
                puts Austin lightyears ahead of what we are currently fightign to build today. 5 miles is thrice as large as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loop_(CTA)">The famous loop of the Chicago L</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Repeating patterns</h4>
            <p>In my fictional version of Austin, the main metro lines tend to follow the <a href="">real world alighnments</a> of Austin's proposed and planned rapid transit routes.
            This comes from Federal Transit Adminstration guidelines; grants are given to projects that have the most promising ridership and the most potential to serve communities in need.
            The facts and data are in agreement, and it's a reasonable starting point for my own worldbuilding.</p>
