            <h1>hi welcome to Waterloo, tx</h1>
            <h2>or Austin, TX, depending on which documents you're looking at</h2>
            <p>When I talk about my urban fantast version of Austin, people usually ask me, 
                "Lexi, why is the city like this?" and the usual response is <span>"It came to me in a dream"</span><br>
            No, literally. I have vivid dreams and I remember a lot of them. In late 2021, I drew out a map of Austin according to what's seen in my dreams.<br>
            This map became basis for the world building I was doing for a urban fantasy story.<br>
            I still need to write the story.
            </p>
            <h3>Let's start with</h3>
            <h2>The Loop</h2>
            <p>In 2017, I had a dream that Austin had a subway loop running downtown instead of Capital Metro's existing commuter rain.<br>
            It was 5 miles long, running under Guadalupe Street, Dean Keaton, Red River Rd, and Cesar Chavez St. It had stations at Republic Square, South Congress, the Convention Center, E 12th, E MLK Jr, Dean Keaton/San Jacinto, W 24th, and W 12th<br>
            There was one question I asked before I woke up: <span>"Is it better for me to ride a subway that doesn't go beyond downtown, or a infrequent commuter train that sort of goes to my part of town?"</span>
            <h3>The Answer Is: Goodness, yes.</h3>
            <p>Do you know how many billions in taxpayer dollars are saved because someone built a subway tunnel in the 1980s? Even if the rest of the system is at grade, a downtown subway loop
                puts Austin lightyears ahead of what we are currently fightign to build today. 5 miles is thrice as large as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loop_(CTA)">The famous loop of the Chicago L</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Repeating patterns</h4>
            <p>In my fictional version of Austin, the main metro lines tend to follow the <a href="">real world alighnments</a> of Austin's proposed and planned rapid transit routes.
            This comes from Federal Transit Adminstration guidelines; grants are given to projects that have the most promising ridership and the most potential to serve communities in need.
            The facts and data are in agreement, and it's a reasonable starting point for my own worldbuilding.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>Saint Elmo Center</h4>
            <p>The intersection of Congress Avenue and Ben White Boulevard is adjacent to one of the largest transit hubs in south Austin. The old Dallas & Pacific mainline snakes
            through South Austin, then dog-legs over to the old Missouri Pacific mainline, crossing Congress just south of Ben White. The 2nd shopping center in Austin, Saint Elmo
                Center, was built in 1973 - it spurred on increased development in the area. The WTXMA now runs the S1 on the D&P, the M1 over Congress Ave, and the T2 along Ben White and the Bergstorm Spur. Saint Elmo also serves regional and intercity services heading to San Antonio, Houston, and Southeast Texas.</p>
            <h4>Redbud Center</h4>
            <p>2nd Downtown in Westlake. <br><span>2nd Downtown in Westlake</span><br>
            I'm not sure of the origin, but there is a recorruing vision of a large business district in the rough area between Mopac, 2244, 360, the West Austin Antena Farm, and the Colorado River.</p>
